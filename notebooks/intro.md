# iPOGS Project Summary:
Current predictions and projections of future sea-level changes are based on CMIP-class climate model simulations. Although this class of models is capable of simulating global sea-level rise and its basic spatial patterns, they are unable to robustly and accurately predict or project future regional and local sea-level changes because of their limitation in representing complex coastline and bathymetry features and regional ocean circulations with their coarse (~100 km) resolutions. More specifically, sea-level changes within the Gulf of Mexico are closely linked to changes in the Loop Current and its eddies, which cannot be resolved by CMIP-class models. This project will address this fundamental issue by using a global eddy-resolving (~10 km) version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-HR) combined with its submesoscale-eddy-permitting (~3 km) regional version (R-CESM). A particular focus area of the proposed research will be on advancing understanding of the Gulf sea-level changes associated with steric variability and ocean dynamics, including changes in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation. Specifically, the research team proposes to: 1) conduct a set of CESM-HR century-long future climate simulations under different emission scenarios to project long-term (up to year 2100) sea-level change in the Gulf; 2) perform an ensemble of CESM-HR decadal prediction simulations to predict shortterm (1-5 years) sea-level change; 3) carry out a set of R-CESM dynamical downscaling simulations to refine the CESM-HR predictions and projections; and 4) develop probabilistic sea-level prediction and projection products and ready-to-use prediction systems along the Gulf coast for integration into The Nature Conservancyâ€™s online Coastal Resilience Tool for local, regional and state decision making; and 5) contribute to federal and non-federal end-user's efforts in predicting and projecting coastal sea-level changes by bringing a unique set of modeling and application capabilities to significantly address outstanding issues related to sea-level rise in the Gulf of Mexico.
